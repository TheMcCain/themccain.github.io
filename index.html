<h1><u>TheMcCain ALERT: THEY WANT TO SENTENCE ME TO DEATH!!!!</h1></u>

<hr>

  <h2>Responding to the allegations</h2> 
  <p>I've faced quite a lot of controversies in this server and I'd like to address them.</p>

  <h2>The "Clinton thirsting"</h2>
  <p>If you've been in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/CfS6yTtjZj" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> server</a>, you'll notice whenever there's discussion of female politicians, sometimes the discussion can quickly degenerate into whether they're attractive or not. I will admit I'm one of the biggest offenders.  </p>
  <p>It is <i>especially</i> common when people are talking about Hillary Clinton.</p>
  <p>If you think that this is a niche exclusive to TCT though, you'd be wrong. The fantasizing over young Hillary Rodham Clinton is actually all over the Internet. Here's one on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidents/comments/1lp9qns/hillary_rodham_clinton_1997/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Reddit.</a> Here's another, same subreddit. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidents/comments/1dred7g/90s_hillary_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" target=\"_blank\">Thousands of comments here.</a> Subreddits that have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Losercity/comments/1q49dvp/losercity_mass_harassment/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" target=\"_blank\">nothing</a> to do with her still end up having this.</p>
  <p>If you think this is also just a temporary fad caused by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginaryelections/comments/1qbgiv1/comment/nzfd8a0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sabrina Carpenter's</a> rise, that's also not the case. This "thirsting" over her has been happening since she entered politics, but to understand why, we need to take a step back.</p>
  <p>I think the best way of showing this is the Hillary Clinton cleavage scandal. Yes, that's a real scandal. It started in 2007 with Washington Post Editor Robby Givhan, who wrote an entire article on Hillary Clinton's, well, cleavage. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/19/AR2007071902668_pf.html" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The article</a> article used some colorful language, like...</p>
  <ul>
  <li><blockquote>There was cleavage on display Wednesday afternoon on C-SPAN2. It belonged to Sen. Hillary Clinton.</blockquote></li>
  <li><blockquote>The last time Clinton wore anything that was remotely sexy in a public setting surely must have been more than a decade ago.</blockquote></li>
  <li><blockquote>With Clinton, there was the sense that you were catching a surreptitious glimpse at something private. You were intruding -- being a voyeur. Showing cleavage is a request to be engaged in a particular way.</blockquote></li>
  <li><blockquote> It doesn't necessarily mean that a woman is asking to be objectified, but it does suggest a certain confidence and physical ease. It means that a woman is content being perceived as a sexual person in addition to being seen as someone who is intelligent, authoritative, witty and whatever else might define her personality. It also means that she feels that all those other characteristics are so apparent and undeniable, that they will not be overshadowed.</blockquote></li>
  </ul>

 <p> The article sparked massive amounts of backlash from feminists. Clinton's campaign staff even took advantage of the incident to fundraise for her 2008 campaign. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/la-op-allen5aug05-story.html" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Here,</a> you can see LA Times writer Charlotte Allen was clearly thirsting over Hillary Clinton.  </p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>Here’s what I think about the so-called Hillary Clinton cleavage controversy: She looked fabulous. Unfortunately, thanks to the vigilance and stridency of Clinton’s legions of feminist supporters in the media, who rose to collectively denounce a Washington Post fashion writer who dared to notice that Clinton had displayed an inch of cleavage while speaking on the Senate floor, we are unlikely ever again to see her looking so forthrightly feminine, so classily sexy, so zaftigly maternal -- so downright attractive.</blockquote></li>
  <li><blockquote>So, it was a refreshing break to see Clinton attired in clothes that actually looked good on her when she was captured by C-SPAN2 on the Senate floor July 18. She has, ahem, put on a few pounds since she ran for the Senate in 2000, and as all gorgeous women of a certain weight know, from Cecilia Bartoli to Mo’Nique, the name of the game is to concentrate the viewer’s attention on your above-the-waist assets, which, thanks to that nourishing layer of subcutaneous you-know-what, typically include lustrous skin and luxuriant hair. Clinton has both, and she also has a bust line that larger women don’t have to pay a plastic surgeon to possess.</blockquote></li>
  <li><blockquote>Everything that Clinton wore that day on the Senate floor -- the soft rose-pink jacket, simple and tasteful, that highlighted her pearlescent complexion; the matching pink necklace; and the black shirt with a slight V-neck that revealed a “small acknowledgment of sexuality and femininity peeking out of the conservative” (to quote Post writer Robin Givhan) -- brought out her female best.</blockquote></li>
  <li><blockquote>It’s fine to aver, a la feminist psychologist Carol Gilligan, that women are the kinder, gentler, softer sex -- and also to advertise one’s softer sexuality by declining to dress in the covered-up uniform of men. But if you dare call people’s attention to that fact, as Givhan did, you’re a sexist pig.</blockquote></li>
  <li><blockquote>she would do better to take a leaf from the book of the powerful women in history who boldly used every weapon in their arsenals to hold their own in a world dominated by men: not only their brilliant minds but also their looks and their sexuality. They include Elizabeth I, who decked herself with every pearl that could be fished out of the Indian Ocean, and Cleopatra, who seduced two Roman rulers.</blockquote></li>

</ul>

  <p>And that's not even close to everything said in that article. The LA Times is the largest newspaper on the West Coast, by the way.</p>
