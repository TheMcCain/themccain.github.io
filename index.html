<h1><u>TheMcCain ALERT: THEY WANT TO SENTENCE ME TO DEATH!!!!</h1></u>
  
<p> I decided to make a website because the TCT moderators are <b><strong><span class='mytooltip'>corrupt<span class='mytooltiptext'>I am actually serious when I say this.</span></span></strong></b></p>
 <p>This website was made manually with Git Pages. It's pretty fun once you get the hang of it.</p> 
<p>I've just kind of gotten bored of TCT. The game isn't as fun and new mods aren't as exciting as they used to be for me 3 years ago.  </p>

  <h2>Responding to the allegations</h2> 
  <p>I've faced quite a lot of controversies in this server and I'd like to address them.</p>

  <h2>The "Clinton thirsting"</h2>
  <p>If you've been in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/CfS6yTtjZj" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> server</a>, you'll notice whenever there's discussion of female politicians, sometimes the discussion can quickly degenerate into whether they're attractive or not. I will admit I'm one of the biggest offenders.  </p>
  <p>It is <i>especially</i> common when people are talking about Hillary Clinton.</p>
  <p>If you think that this is a niche exclusive to TCT though, you'd be wrong. The fantasizing over young Hillary Rodham Clinton is actually all over the Internet. Here's one on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidents/comments/1lp9qns/hillary_rodham_clinton_1997/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Reddit.</a> Here's another, same subreddit. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidents/comments/1dred7g/90s_hillary_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" target=\"_blank\">Thousands of comments here.</a> Subreddits that have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Losercity/comments/1q49dvp/losercity_mass_harassment/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" target=\"_blank\">nothing</a> to do with her still end up having this.</p>
<p>If you think this is also just a temporary fad caused by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginaryelections/comments/1qbgiv1/comment/nzfd8a0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sabrina Carpenter's</a> rise, that's also not the case. I think the best way of showing this is the Hillary Clinton cleavage scandal. Yes, that's a real scandal. It started in 2007 with a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/19/AR2007071902668_pf.html" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Post</a> article, back when Hillary was still a Senator. The article uses some colorful language, calling her " </p>

        It's kind of surprising she's as irrelevant as she is given how much of a towering figure she used to be.
