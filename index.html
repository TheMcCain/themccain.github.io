<h1><u>TheMcCain ALERT: THEY WANT TO SENTENCE ME TO DEATH!!!!</h1></u>

<hr>

  <h2>Responding to the allegations</h2> 
  <p>I've faced quite a lot of controversies in this server and I'd like to address them.</p>

  <h2>The "Clinton thirsting"</h2>
  <p>If you've been in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/CfS6yTtjZj" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> server</a>, you'll notice whenever there's discussion of female politicians, sometimes the discussion can quickly degenerate into whether they're attractive or not. I will admit I'm one of the biggest offenders.  </p>
  <p>It is <i>especially</i> common when people are talking about Hillary Clinton.</p>
  <p>If you think that this is a niche exclusive to TCT though, you'd be wrong. The fantasizing over young Hillary Rodham Clinton is actually all over the Internet. Here's one on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidents/comments/1lp9qns/hillary_rodham_clinton_1997/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Reddit.</a> Here's another, same subreddit. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidents/comments/1dred7g/90s_hillary_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" target=\"_blank\">Thousands of comments here.</a> Subreddits that have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Losercity/comments/1q49dvp/losercity_mass_harassment/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" target=\"_blank\">nothing</a> to do with her still end up having this.</p>
  <p>If you think this is also just a temporary fad caused by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginaryelections/comments/1qbgiv1/comment/nzfd8a0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sabrina Carpenter's</a> rise, that's also not the case. The sexualization of Hillary Clinton has been happening since she entered politics, but to understand why, we need to take a step back.</p>
  <p>I think the best way of showing this was the <span class='mytooltip'>Hillary Clinton cleavage scandal.<span class='mytooltiptext'><img src=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120051115if_/http://corner.nationalreview.com/images/hillary_cspan2.jpg> An example of her wearing revealing clothing.</span></span>. Yes, that's a real scandal.<br> It started in 2007 with Washington Post Editor Robby Givhan, who wrote an entire article on Hillary Clinton's, well, cleavage. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/19/AR2007071902668_pf.html" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The article</a> used some colorful language, like...</p>
  <ul>
  <li><blockquote>There was cleavage on display Wednesday afternoon on C-SPAN2. It belonged to Sen. Hillary Clinton.</blockquote></li>
  <li><blockquote>The last time Clinton wore anything that was remotely sexy in a public setting surely must have been more than a decade ago.</blockquote></li>
  <li><blockquote>With Clinton, there was the sense that you were catching a surreptitious glimpse at something private. You were intruding -- being a voyeur. Showing cleavage is a request to be engaged in a particular way.</blockquote></li>
  <li><blockquote> It doesn't necessarily mean that a woman is asking to be objectified, but it does suggest a certain confidence and physical ease. It means that a woman is content being perceived as a sexual person in addition to being seen as someone who is intelligent, authoritative, witty and whatever else might define her personality. It also means that she feels that all those other characteristics are so apparent and undeniable, that they will not be overshadowed.</blockquote></li>
  </ul>

 <p> The article sparked massive amounts of backlash from feminists. Clinton's campaign staff even took advantage of the incident to fundraise for her 2008 campaign. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/la-op-allen5aug05-story.html" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Here,</a> you can see LA Times writer Charlotte Allen was clearly thirsting over Hillary Clinton.  </p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>We are unlikely ever again to see her looking so forthrightly feminine, so classily sexy, so zaftigly maternal -- so downright attractive.</blockquote></li>
  <li><blockquote>Everything that Clinton wore that day on the Senate floor -- the soft, rose-pink jacket, simple and tasteful, that highlighted her pearlescent complexion; the matching pink necklace; and the black shirt with a slight V-neck that revealed a “small acknowledgment of sexuality and femininity peeking out of the conservative” (to quote Post writer Robin Givhan) -- brought out her female best.</blockquote></li>

</ul>
  <p><small>You know it's been a slow day when this is the big issue all the big news outlets are talking about...</small></p>

  <p>And that's not even close to everything said in that article. The LA Times is the largest newspaper on the West Coast, by the way.</p>

  <p>And that, is just scratching the surface. Tucker Carlson called her "castrating, overbearing, and scary". Mark Levin referred to her as "Her Thighness". Her 2006 Senate opponent, John Spencer, was reported to have commented on how much better Clinton looked in the 2000s compared to in the 1970s, and speculated that she had cosmetic surgery.</p>

  <p>So now that we've established Hillary Clinton has been sexualized for years now, the more important question is why? We'll get into that.</p>
