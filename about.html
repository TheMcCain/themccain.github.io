<p>I make election mockups, TCT mods, wikiboxes, alternate history, blog about NY transit and politics, and code a bunch of other stuff as a hobby.</p>

  <h1>My work</h1>

  <h2>TCT Mods</h2> 
  <ul>
  <li> <a href="https://campaigntrailshowcase.com/campaign-trail/?modName=2016%20-%20Tough%20As%20Texas" target="_blank">  Tough as Texas</a> - Mod where you can play as Ted Cruz and run his 2016 presidential campaign. It has a lot of endings,
    secret paths, and more. It's definitely my magnum opus!</li>
    <li><a href="https://campaigntrailshowcase.com/campaign-trail/?modName=2000BushRedux" target="_blank"> 2000 Redux</a> - My first TCT mod. It's not that good and I suggest you don't play it. Also has a "work in progress" Gore, Nader, and Buchanan 
    side that is never coming out.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Wikiboxes</h2>
